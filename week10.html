        <h3>Week 10: Hyperskill Part 3</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 19 - June 24) Cinema Room REST Service</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Hyperskill</h4>
        <p>
          Previously I had said that after the Music Advisor I'd go for the
          Account Service project, however I quickly changed my mind after
          seeing the difficulty rating and went for the
          <strong>Cinema Room</strong> project instead. Despite being classified
          as "hard" this project proved a lot easier than the first one due to
          not having any of the roadblocks mentioned in previous entries: The
          instructions were more straightforward, it was up to date and the
          tests were written to reflect the actual requirements for each stage.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_completed.png" />
        <p>
          Instead of a couple weeks it took a total of five days to complete the
          Cinema Room: Three days for the sixty-something lessons, working six
          hours at a time give or take, and two more days for the four project
          stages.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_progress.png" />
        <p>
          Due to being short on time I tried to jump into the Account Service
          project stages right away, but got stuck in stage 2/7 which deals with
          Spring Security. I went back to the lessons and now it seems like I
          might be able to work through the second stage but I don't see myself
          progressing through the other five stages fast enough to finish by the
          27th.
        </p>
        <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
        <p>
          I did my second lightning talk on Recursion and Recursive Functions. I
          thought it would be an interesting topic with many visual examples, it
          also gave me the opportunity to relax a little and code a small
          program for drawing flowers as a break from the Hyperskill stuff.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_turtle.png" />
        <p>
          While I think there was a marked improvement from my previous talk I
          still see many areas that need work for the last talk next week. Not
          only individually but also as teams the organization for the LTs has
          been too loose and that's something we should improve for the closing
          session, I'd like to create an introductory slide with our names and
          topics so that guests have something to see while they wait for the
          LTs to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm yet to decide on the topic for my last LT, however I really liked
          the angle Karen gave to her talk about data driven choices in F1.
          Tying the topic to one area of application made it that much easier to
          follow, so I'd like to do something like that. I was tempted to do an
          LT about <em>coding patterns</em> in general and how they originated
          in Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em>, a book on
          Urbanism and Architecture. However I'd rather focus on something that
          I've picked up during the apprentice program.
        </p>
        <h4>Agile Month</h4>
        <p>
          Something I've neglected to mention in previous entries is that we're
          right in the middle of Agile Month at Encora, and we've been having a
          series of talks on the matter. This week we met with Oscar Hernandez
          for the talk <em>User Story Slicing,</em> despite the name it also
          explained what a user story was from the ground up, something very
          useful since I'd only been introduced to the topic recently. To me it
          sounds similar to "personas" used in other design fields.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_agiletalk.png" />
        <p>
          We had one more talk before the end of the week however it wasn't
          related to Agile. We met with Rafael Gutierrez who had been helping us
          with some Java topics to talk about Collections. It was very well
          timed, since it touched on the same topics I was looking at in the
          Hyperskill platform.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_javatalk2.png" />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          While I feel kinda bad about being unable to finish all three
          Hyperskill projects in the time given, I see many more positives than
          negatives. Before this module Java was like a huge wall that I saw no
          way to climb, while now I see a clear path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll look into what I can do to further practice the skills I've
          picked up so far. Hyperskill has other projects that are supposed to
          be completed in one go, I think those would be a good option if we
          retain access to the platform.
