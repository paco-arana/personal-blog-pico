        <h3>Week 04: A Breakable Toy Experiment</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(Apr 25 - May 9) Individual console line application</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After delivering the team coding assignments we were given a new task,
          we now had to recreate <em>Ledger</em> a CLI application for
          accounting. The real <em>Ledger</em> is a very powerful and complete
          tool, however, so in order to keep things reasonable we only had to
          implement three commands and three flags. The commands given were
          <strong>register, balance, and print.</strong> while the flags to
          implement were
          <strong>--sort, --file, and --price-db.</strong>
        </p>
        <h4>Command: register</h4>
        <p>
          The command <strong>register</strong> outputs a list of all the
          transactions, formatted like a double entry accounting book. Going
          left to right we have a date for the transaction, the accounts
          involved, the value traded in the transaction and finally a running
          balance, which is independent for each currency or symbol used.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/register.png" alt="output of register command" />
        <p>
          In order to output the data in this format the code must read through
          every filename specified in "index.ledger". Then parse every entry
          contained in the files and append them to a dictionary. The dictionary
          is formatted like a JSON so that it can be read by the python library
          <em>Pandas</em> and turned into a dataframe. This was done to
          facilitate the task of formatting the output, filtering and sorting.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/entrymaker.png"
          alt="code used to parse through files"
        />
        <p>
          By using the optional flag <strong>--account</strong> the table can be
          narrowed down to only the transactions where the account specified was
          involved. The choice was made to implement this functionality as a
          flag instead of a positional attribute of
          <strong>register</strong> because that was simpler to implement using
          the argparse library.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/register_a.png"
          alt="output of register command when using account flag"
        />
        <h4>Command: balance</h4>
        <p>
          The command <strong>balance</strong>
          outputs the total balance of all accounts. Because in the
          <strong>register</strong> command we already have a running balance
          column, we could reuse most of the code for register by moving it to
          its own function. Then we simply use pandas to colapse the running
          balance column, so we only keep the last value on it.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/balance_brain.png"
          alt="code used to create the balance output"
        />
        <p>
          Like <strong>register</strong> this command could also make use of the
          account flag to only show the total of the transactions involving that
          account.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/balance_a.png" alt="output of balance command" />
        <h4>Command: print</h4>
        <p>
          The command <strong>print</strong> was to me the simplest one, as it
          only needs to read through the ledger data and prints it out in an
          homogenized format. I reused most of the code from the previous two
          commands. As with both previous commands, <strong>print</strong> can
          make use of the account flag to select which accounts to actually
          show.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/print.png" alt="output of print command" />
        <h4>Flag: --prices-db</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>--prices-db</strong> flag does two things: It tells ledger
          that you want the output to show in a single currency, and in the
          specified file it lets you define what currency to output and what the
          exchange rate will be. Out of the optional flags this was the most
          involved one, so much that the code was split off for the register
          command, there is one version for its normal functioning and another
          for when this command is called.
        </p>

          src="./pictures/prices_code.png"
          alt="code used to change units and convert according to exchange rate"
        />
        <p>
          Compare the output when the function is not called and when it is:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/prices_bal.png"
          alt="output of balance when using prices-database command"
        />
        <img
          src="./pictures/prices_reg.png"
          alt="output of register when using prices-database command"
        />
        <h4>Flag: --file</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>--file</strong> flag specifies what file should be used as
          the index, the index.ledger text file contains the filenames of all
          entries for ledger. Being that ledger is originally an accounting
          tool, this could be considered a useful functionality to change
          between clients, for example. In the case of our implementation though
          we always default back to "index.ledger" when executing the code
          again. The implementation of this flag was very simple, we converted
          all references to index.ledger to variables and used an if statement
          to check if the flag was being passed as an argument.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/file_code.png"
          alt="if statement used to check if file was passed as an argument"
        />
        <h4>Flag: --sort</h4>
        <p>
          The <strong>--sort</strong> flag is used to sort the output, the real
          <em>Ledger</em> can take any EXPR as an argument, in our case we have
          only included "date" and variations as valid arguments.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/register_sorted.png"
          alt="register output sorted by date"
        />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          Ledger is one of the most complex programs that I've built on my own,
          if not the most complex. There was a moment when I felt like the
          complexity was too much to handle by myself. But as I powered through
          I found it really rewarding and by splitting my functions over many
          files I found it easier to keep track of everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made many mistakes while building Ledger, I should've read more
          carefully what each function was supposed to do, as I found myself
          having to go back to tweak the code many times. However I don't regret
          starting to code without having the full picture, there was nothing i
          wrote that didn't come useful later, and I hold the belief that
          getting started is usually the most difficult part of any project.
