            <h3>TEST</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>(June 19 - June 24) Cinema Room REST Service</strong>
            </p>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <h4>Hyperskill</h4>
          <p>
            Previously I had said that after the Music Advisor I'd go for the
            Account Service project, however I quickly changed my mind after
            seeing the difficulty rating and went for the
            <strong>Cinema Room</strong> project instead. Despite being
            classified as "hard" this project proved a lot easier than the first
            one due to not having any of the roadblocks mentioned in previous
            entries: The instructions were more straightforward, it was up to
            date and the tests were written to reflect the actual requirements
            for each stage.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/week10_completed.png" />
          <p>
            Instead of a couple weeks it took a total of five days to complete
            the Cinema Room: Three days for the sixty-something lessons, working
            six hours at a time give or take, and two more days for the four
            project stages.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/week10_progress.png" />
          <p>
            Due to being short on time I tried to jump into the Account Service
            project stages right away, but got stuck in stage 2/7 which deals
            with Spring Security. I went back to the lessons and now it seems
            like I might be able to work through the second stage but I don't
            see myself progressing through the other five stages fast enough to
            finish by the 27th.
          </p>
          <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
          <p>
            I did my second lightning talk on Recursion and Recursive Functions.
            I thought it would be an interesting topic with many visual
            examples, it also gave me the opportunity to relax a little and code
            a small program for drawing flowers as a break from the Hyperskill
            stuff.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/week10_turtle.png" />
          <p>
            While I think there was a marked improvement from my previous talk I
            still see many areas that need work for the last talk next week. Not
            only individually but also as teams the organization for the LTs has
            been too loose and that's something we should improve for the
            closing session, I'd like to create an introductory slide with our
            names and topics so that guests have something to see while they
            wait for the LTs to start.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm yet to decide on the topic for my last LT, however I really
            liked the angle Karen gave to her talk about data driven choices in
            F1. Tying the topic to one area of application made it that much
            easier to follow, so I'd like to do something like that. I was
            tempted to do an LT about <em>coding patterns</em> in general and
            how they originated in Christopher Alexander's
            <em>A Pattern Language</em>, a book on Urbanism and Architecture.
            However I'd rather focus on something that I've picked up during the
            apprentice program.
          </p>
          <h4>Agile Month</h4>
          <p>
            Something I've neglected to mention in previous entries is that
            we're right in the middle of Agile Month at Encora, and we've been
            having a series of talks on the matter. This week we met with Oscar
            Hernandez for the talk <em>User Story Slicing,</em> despite the name
            it also explained what a user story was from the ground up,
            something very useful since I'd only been introduced to the topic
            recently. To me it sounds similar to "personas" used in other design
            fields.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/week10_agiletalk.png" />
          <p>
            We had one more talk before the end of the week however it wasn't
            related to Agile. We met with Rafael Gutierrez who had been helping
            us with some Java topics to talk about Collections. It was very well
            timed, since it touched on the same topics I was looking at in the
            Hyperskill platform.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/week10_javatalk2.png" />
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            While I feel kinda bad about being unable to finish all three
            Hyperskill projects in the time given, I see many more positives
            than negatives. Before this module Java was like a huge wall that I
            saw no way to climb, while now I see a clear path forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll look into what I can do to further practice the skills I've
            picked up so far. Hyperskill has other projects that are supposed to
            be completed in one go, I think those would be a good option if we
            retain access to the platform.

            <h3>Week 09: Hyperskill Part 2</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>(June 11 - June 17) Music Advisor Wrap-up</strong>
            </p>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>
            No big change of pace this week, we picked up right where we had
            left off, having just finished stage 2 of the
            <strong>Music Advisor</strong>. Stages 3, 4 and 5 were lighter on
            the theory but much heavier on the practice. I spent a couple days
            stuck at stage 3/5, just couldn't wrap my mind around how HTTP
            requests worked on Java and if I'm honest never really felt I
            understood it completely, I sort of pieced it through trial and
            error. The weird thing is that now that I look back on it it's
            crystal clear what it does, but at the time? I felt like I was
            writing a magic spell rather than code:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/hyperskill_authcode.png"
            alt="Authorization code"
          />
          <p>
            The good part is that I'd then have to do more of the same for stage
            4/5, so now it's almost burnt into my memory, it should be much
            easier to figure it out if i ever do forget it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real challenge for stage 4 was actually the tests. I spent a
            whole afternoon figuring out how to work around one of the tests, as
            it seemed like the logic of the test itself was internally flawed in
            some way. The comments in Hyperskill's page said as much and did
            give some hints. I ended up placing the whole block of code in a big
            try-catch block that fed the test the answer it wanted to get.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/hyperskill_trycatch.png"
            alt="Try catch block in code"
          />
          <p>
            By "feeding" I mean that I had to hardcode the error messages
            printed to the user, as actually reading the response error message
            as specified in the instructions would fail the test.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stage 5 was relatively easier, only really asked that we added
            pagination to the project. It also suggested that we modified the
            project to fit into the Model-View-Controller architecture patter, I
            gave it an honest to god attempt but basically broke everything in
            the process so I rolled back the changes, at that point I also felt
            I had invested far too much time on the Music Advisor project and it
            was time to wrap it up.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end it took a bit less time to complete than the couple
            previous stages. The tests were complicated to get through but more
            straightforward in the sense that they actually followed the
            behavior specified in the instructions. When I finally got the
            pop-up window telling me I had completed the project I literally
            stood up from my seat:
          </p>

            src="./pictures/hyperskill_finished.png"
            alt="Message shown when finishing a hyperskill project"
          />
          <p>
            I'm happy to put the <strong>Music Advisor</strong> behind me and
            start fresh, I decided on the
            <strong>Account Service</strong> project to do second. It seems like
            a good deal of the lessons learned in the previous project will
            carry over and I'm crossing my fingers hoping I don't get stuck
            again, as I only have about a week and a half to get through two
            more projects to meet the June 29th deadline.

            </p>

          <hr />
          <p>
            I must admit that I was pretty excited to start the Hyperskill
            module, most of what I knew about software prior to entering the
            apprenticeship program I learned in online platforms like Coursera,
            Udemy and Khan Academy. So at least on paper it seemed like I'd be
            at home in the Hyperskill platform, things didn't go as smoothly as
            I'd have hoped though.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first sign that something was different with Hyperskill was
            perhaps the project times. Usually when starting out with a new
            programming language you're told to do (many) short projects in the
            style of "100 days of code" challenges, but instead we were tasked
            with three projects that according to the platform took a couple
            dozen hours to complete each, something that on paper seems like a
            pretty daunting task. On a related note, the estimates themselves
            also seem far too optimistic, as I put a week of full time work into
            the first project and I'm just over the halfway mark it seems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be fair though, I can imagine that it's only taking so long for
            me to work through the project because I'm almost a complete
            beginner in all things Java, something that should be clear to
            anyone who looks through the code for my To Do App. In that regard
            the lessons that are interspersed with the projects have been quite
            useful, and I can already imagine how much I could improve on that
            code with what I learned through this week. Just as easily I can
            also imagine a more experienced Java user or someone with a more
            formal education skipping through those lessons and finishing the
            project in half of what it's said to take to complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me the most interesting lessons so far have been those at the end
            of stage 2/5, until then most lessons were dealing with concepts I
            already knew except now on Java, but stuff like Software
            Architecture, Patterns, Class Diagrams, all those are entirely new
            to me, only having heard about them without actually having an
            understanding of what they were and why they were useful.

          <p>
            After finishing the Todo App we were tasked with the Lightning
            Talks, a series of three individual presentations that we should
            give over the next three weeks. The first of these talks should be
            on a topic related to the Todo App and last a total of 10 minutes
            plus questions. The following talks should shorten that time to 7
            and then to 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my case I decided to focus the talk on the CRUD operations:
            Create, Read, Update and Delete. Because I think the Todo App also
            serves as the perfect way to illustrate this concepts due to its
            functionality and architecture. The cover is a reference to the
            Evangelion title cards, I wonder if anyone actually caught that:

            Salma invited everyone who wanted to join her to give our
            presentations on wednesday but I was the only one who agreed. The
            rest of the apprentice team decided to give their presentations on
            friday. Going first has both advantages and disadvantages: The
            advantages are that you get to set the bar since the expectations
            are at the lowest, you also get the feedback early and can start
            focusing on the next presentation sooner. As to the disadvantages,
            you don't get to see other people's presentations and learn from
            their mistakes, and have in practical terms less time to create and
            rehearse the presentation.
          </p>
          <img
            style="

          />
          <p>
            Salma and me had to deal with some unforeseen problems too, namely
            we hadn't set up zoom to allow us to share our screens, so we had to
            get out and back into the meeting halfway before starting our
            respective presentations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than that I'd say everything went pretty smoothly. I already
            received some of the feedback and based on that there's points that
            I'd like to work on. I've been told that I don't modulate my voice
            enough, which causes it to become a "drone" in the more wordy parts
            of the presentation. I've also been corrected on the pronunciation
            of some words, like specifically (the "a" is mute) and CRUD
            (pronounced "crud" instead of "cee ar u dee").
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people also brought up positive points, like the visuals of the
            presentation and the balance between the words on the screen and
            those on my script.
          </p>
          <img
            style="
              border-radius: 20px;

          <p>
            In the final slide of the presentation I brought back the same
            thought that I used to finish the blog entry last week. Some times
            you just need to ask for help. I wasn't able to get enough rehearsal
            time with Martin Cocoba, who has said he will be helping us with our
            LTs, that's something more I'd like to improve for the next LT.

          <p>
            After one more week of work I got my java API up and running, like
            with the frontend the trick was to start by building the most basic
            implementation of a todo app posible, only including id, text and
            done/undone status. Once I built that and connected to it with
            Postman I could start iterating on it, adding the endpoints and all
            the attributes a todo had to have to be up to the project
            specifications.
          </p>
          <img

            alt="Model used for the todos"
          />
          <img
            src="./pictures/backend_running.png"
            alt="Backend running with spring boot"
          />
          <p>
            The frontend was updated as well to be in line with the
            specifications for the UI. Most of the functionality that was
            previously located in the frontend like sorting and filtering was
            moved to the backend, the only functionality of this type that
            remained coded in the frontend was the pagination control. I
            consider this to be the only real deviation from the project
            specifications, I have to be honest and say I simply didn't manage
            to move it to the backend without breaking basically everything in
            the frontend.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/frontend_base.png"
            alt="View of the frontend on loading the app, some todos have been added for visualization"
          />
          <p>Let's review the specifications for the UI:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Search/Filtering Controls</li>
            <li>
              New To Do Button. This should open a modal to type the “to do”
              data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Priority column should show in the header the classic up and down
              arrows to allow the user to sort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due date column should show in the header the classic up and own
              arrows to allow the user to sort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Action column to show actions (links/buttons) to allow the user to
              delete or edit a “to do”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pagination control. Showing the pages, its number and the next and
              previous page is enough.
            </li>
            <li>Area to show the metrics</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I think it's all there, I might add a parenthesis on number 5: The
            full specifications said that we <em>could</em> use a modal similar
            to the one used to add a todo, in the case of editing I decided not
            to grey out the rest of the page, to make it faster if I chose to
            edit multiple todos at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll look at some of this points closer as we walk through the
            backend specifications.
          </p>
          <h4>GET Endpoint</h4>
          <p>
            The GET endpoint is by far the most complicated, as it has to handle
            sorting and search, a total of 4 request parameters. Despite this I
            think it's relatively straightforward and self-explaining, somments
            have been added to point what each section does:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/backend_GET.png"
            alt="GET endpoint in Java backend"
          />
          <p>
            In our app this endpoint is called to not only on loading or
            searching but basically anytime a todo is updated, marked as
            complete or added, as it's our means of updating the display of
            todos without resorting to refreshing the page.
          </p>
          <h4>POST Endpoint</h4>
          <p>
            The POST endpoint is set to receive a task object, it performs
            validations by making sure the received task has the bare minimum
            attributes required, a text field and a priority. In theory it is
            also impossible to submit an empty Todo from the frontend.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/backend_POST.png"
            alt="POST endpoint in Java backend"
          />
          <p>
            As specified, the POST request is made when we click "Add" on our
            modal element. Priority is set to "Low" by default and the user is
            not given the choice to submit a todo without a priority.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/frontend_modal.png"
            alt="View of the modal element in frontend"
          />
          <h4>PUT Endpoints</h4>
          <p>
            There are actually three separate PUT requests that can be made to
            the API, one for the edit menu where we can change a todo's text,
            priority and due date, one for marking a todo as done, and a final
            one to mark a todo as undone. I personally would have preferred to
            use a single "toggle" endpoint to manage both done and undone
            states, but such was the specification.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/backend_PUT.png"
            alt="All three PUT endpoints in the API"
          />
          Each endpoint receives an ID in order to find the todo that is going
          to be updated. In the case of the updateTodo function we also receive
          a task object containing the new information, the same basic
          validations as in the createTodo function are also performed.
          <img
            src="./pictures/frontend_edit.png"
            alt="Editing the todos from the frontend"
          />
          <h4>DELETE Endpoint</h4>
          <p>
            Something that was missing in the original specification was an
            endpoint in the API to delete todos, the especifications only said
            that we should have the means to do it but not how. If there was
            another way to achieve the same thing it didn't seem obvious to me.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/backend_DELETE.png"
            alt="The endpoint used to delete todos"
          />
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            It's hard for me to write a conclusion to this entry because there
            is still work left to do, namely implementing the tests. However
            speaking on the experience so far I have to say this project taught
            me to ask for help when stuck, I lost a good four days of progress
            just trying to figure out how to run the Java backend, when I
            finally decided to just ask someone we got the basics of the API
            done in about three hours. For the tests I'll go straight to the
            point and ask one of the other apprentices who has already
            implemented them in their apps.

            With Ledger CLI behind us it seemed like things couldn't get much
            harder, looking back on it one week later that seems like a very
            optimistic view. Being objective the premise is much simpler, To-do
            apps are very common beginner projects, in essence it should be much
            simpler than the accounting tool that is Ledger:

          </blockquote>
          <h4>Back End</h4>
          <p>
            The back end is proving to be the hardest to crack despite it only
            needing to handle a few requests. Personally I have no experience
            with Java, the language prescribed for the assignment, much less so
            with its related tools like Spring, Maven or Java Collections. To
            this we also have to add the technical issues caused by ZScaler, the
            company's VPN, for obvious security reasons it is particularly
            aggressive, which made it almost impossible to deploy locally for
            testing. Most of us had to resort to disabling during testing which
            is not an ideal solution.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/address_failure.png"
            alt="View of Intellij Idea failing to start the local servers"
          />
          <p>
            It took essentially the whole week to get a CRUD server to run, as
            once we had solved the ZScaler issue we still had to deal with the
            fiddly Maven installation process, the breaking changes that Spring
            3.0 introduced that rendered most online guides useless and in my
            case my own lack of familiarity with backend development.

            alt="Maven failed to install manually or with brew"
          />
          <h4>Front End</h4>
          <p>
            The front end is where most of the functionality of the program is
            located, the specifications were that it had to be built using
            React, a javascript framework. I was already familiarized with react
            from previous projects, but still decided to use a tutorial for
            building the base of the project. Compared to the back end we
            advanced a great deal in the span of a couple of days, with most of
            the functionality implemented.

          />
          <p>
            Due to being unable to get the back end running in a timely manner
            the app is currently running with a Firebase database, the functions
            that communicate with the database have been grouped together to
            make the change later to the local java backend

            <p>

          <p>
            After delivering the team coding assignments we were given a new
            task, we now had to recreate <em>Ledger</em> a CLI application for
            accounting. The real <em>Ledger</em> is a very powerful and complete
            tool, however, so in order to keep things reasonable we only had to
            implement three commands and three flags. The commands given were
            <strong>register, balance, and print.</strong> while the flags to
            implement were
            <strong>--sort, --file, and --price-db.</strong>
          </p>
          <h4>Command: register</h4>
          <p>
            The command <strong>register</strong> outputs a list of all the
            transactions, formatted like a double entry accounting book. Going
            left to right we have a date for the transaction, the accounts
            involved, the value traded in the transaction and finally a running
            balance, which is independent for each currency or symbol used.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/register.png" alt="output of register command" />
          <p>
            In order to output the data in this format the code must read
            through every filename specified in "index.ledger". Then parse every
            entry contained in the files and append them to a dictionary. The
            dictionary is formatted like a JSON so that it can be read by the
            python library <em>Pandas</em> and turned into a dataframe. This was
            done to facilitate the task of formatting the output, filtering and
            sorting.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/entrymaker.png"
            alt="code used to parse through files"
          />
          <p>
            By using the optional flag <strong>--account</strong> the table can
            be narrowed down to only the transactions where the account
            specified was involved. The choice was made to implement this
            functionality as a flag instead of a positional attribute of
            <strong>register</strong> because that was simpler to implement
            using the argparse library.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/register_a.png"
            alt="output of register command when using account flag"
          />
          <h4>Command: balance</h4>
          <p>
            The command <strong>balance</strong>
            outputs the total balance of all accounts. Because in the
            <strong>register</strong> command we already have a running balance
            column, we could reuse most of the code for register by moving it to
            its own function. Then we simply use pandas to colapse the running
            balance column, so we only keep the last value on it.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/balance_brain.png"
            alt="code used to create the balance output"
          />
          <p>
            Like <strong>register</strong> this command could also make use of
            the account flag to only show the total of the transactions
            involving that account.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/balance_a.png" alt="output of balance command" />
          <h4>Command: print</h4>
          <p>
            The command <strong>print</strong> was to me the simplest one, as it
            only needs to read through the ledger data and prints it out in an
            homogenized format. I reused most of the code from the previous two
            commands. As with both previous commands, <strong>print</strong> can
            make use of the account flag to select which accounts to actually
            show.
          </p>
          <img src="./pictures/print.png" alt="output of print command" />
          <h4>Flag: --prices-db</h4>
          <p>
            The <strong>--prices-db</strong> flag does two things: It tells
            ledger that you want the output to show in a single currency, and in
            the specified file it lets you define what currency to output and
            what the exchange rate will be. Out of the optional flags this was
            the most involved one, so much that the code was split off for the
            register command, there is one version for its normal functioning
            and another for when this command is called.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/prices_code.png"
            alt="code used to change units and convert according to exchange rate"
          />
          <p>
            Compare the output when the function is not called and when it is:
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/prices_bal.png"
            alt="output of balance when using prices-database command"
          />
          <img
            src="./pictures/prices_reg.png"
            alt="output of register when using prices-database command"
          />
          <h4>Flag: --file</h4>
          <p>
            The <strong>--file</strong> flag specifies what file should be used
            as the index, the index.ledger text file contains the filenames of
            all entries for ledger. Being that ledger is originally an
            accounting tool, this could be considered a useful functionality to
            change between clients, for example. In the case of our
            implementation though we always default back to "index.ledger" when
            executing the code again. The implementation of this flag was very
            simple, we converted all references to index.ledger to variables and
            used an if statement to check if the flag was being passed as an
            argument.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/file_code.png"
            alt="if statement used to check if file was passed as an argument"
          />
          <h4>Flag: --sort</h4>
          <p>
            The <strong>--sort</strong> flag is used to sort the output, the
            real <em>Ledger</em> can take any EXPR as an argument, in our case
            we have only included "date" and variations as valid arguments.
          </p>
          <img
            src="./pictures/register_sorted.png"
            alt="register output sorted by date"
          />
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Ledger is one of the most complex programs that I've built on my
            own, if not the most complex. There was a moment when I felt like
            the complexity was too much to handle by myself. But as I powered
            through I found it really rewarding and by splitting my functions
            over many files I found it easier to keep track of everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made many mistakes while building Ledger, I should've read more
            carefully what each function was supposed to do, as I found myself
            having to go back to tweak the code many times. However I don't
            regret starting to code without having the full picture, there was
            nothing i wrote that didn't come useful later, and I hold the belief
            that getting started is usually the most difficult part of any
            project.

          <p>
            The first couple of weeks in Encora were spent getting to know the
            company and completing the prerequisite courses on matters of
            diversity, communication and security. I can’t speak for everyone,
            but I know at least I was excited to finally be back to coding after
            what felt like a long break. The activities for the week seemed
            simple enough: An individual problem and five team problems, but we
            also had to balance building the foundations of our personal blog,
            making the technical logs and unexpectedly, organizing newbie
            Friday. This was quite the change from the leisurely pace of the
            first couple of weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had a schedule carefully planned for the week, I’d solve the
            individual challenge on the first couple of days, work with the team
            on the team challenges through the next five days and use the
            remaining time to build the blog, if I had enough time left over, I
            would build the blog using Svelte as an SPA, otherwise I would use
            pico.CSS to whip up something fast. You’re most likely looking at
            that “something fast” right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a great plan, but in the words of Mike Tyson: Everyone has a
            plan until they are punched in the face. In my case the punch was
            called “Double or One Thing”.
          </p>
          <h4>Double or One Thing</h4>
          <p>
            We could pick one out of three options for our individual problem.
            Double or One Thing seemed the obvious choice to me, if only because
            I could understand what the problem was even asking for. The
            descriptions for the Google Code Jam problems might as well be
            written in a different language and deciphering them proved to be a
            valuable skill on its own. To quote the problem intro:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            You are given a string of uppercase English letters. You can
            highlight any number of the letters. Then, a new string is produced
            by processing the letters from left to right: non-highlighted
            letters are appended once to the new string, while highlighted
            letters are appended twice. There are multiple strings that can be
            obtained as a result of this process, depending on the highlighting
            choices. Among all of those strings, output the one that appears
            first in alphabetical order.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            To tackle this problem, we are given two options. The first option
            was a brute force solution that writes every possible combination of
            single and double letters to a list, sorts the list, and picks the
            first element. This was simple enough to implement and after a
            couple of hours remembering how to code and another couple figuring
            out how Google Code Jam checks each answer, we had a working
            solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, this wouldn’t cut it for all the test sets. The analysis
            page says as much, this algorithm runs out of time once the words
            get large enough. As if that wasn't bad enough, the optimal solution
            has little to do with the brute force solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            It took another six hours or so to write the second algorithm, most
            of that time was spent writing the wrong algorithm, I had to
            practically start over a couple of times, but we finally had a
            solution that should be capable of solving the samples as well as
            both tests. But somehow, the improved solution was worse than the
            original. Like a person who hasn’t worked out in a while, my brain
            had completely depleted its reserve of abstract thoughts. I decided
            to let it rest and come back to the problem after some days.
          </p>
          <h4>Punched Cards</h4>
          <p>
            On Monday, April 17 we got together as a team to decide how we would
            split the work for the week, we decided on an intentionally
            inefficient strategy: We would split the eight-person team into
            couples, for each problem each team was assigned a language out of
            the four we needed to complete the challenge, we would rotate the
            language for each problem. The goal was that everybody had a chance
            to get familiar with Dart and Kotlin, the languages no one had any
            prior experience with.
          </p>
          <p>
            In retrospective that made things harder for everyone. Every problem
            was essentially “solved” in Python and then rewritten to the other
            languages. And once we realized that Kotlin, for example, had a
            Java-like syntax it seemed obvious that those with prior experience
            with Java would be best suited to port the solutions to the
            language. Had we realized these things earlier on we might have
            saved ourselves some trouble, or we might have ended up doing the
            same since it was the most egalitarian choice. Either way, it was an
            important lesson.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was partnered up with Karen, and for the first problem she had
            already written a solution during the weekend, because that file was
            already on hand it ended up being used to test the GitHub repo that
            Edgar made to store all our solutions. For many of us this was our
            first time uploading to someone else’s repository, so that took a
            bit of trial and error to figure out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Punched Cards ended up giving us no problems, the algorithm was
            simple enough: Write X lines Y times. With just a bit of extra code
            to replace the beginning “cell” of the table with dots.
          </p>
          <h4>3D Printing</h4>
          <p>
            For Tuesday we had to work on the second problem, 3D Printing. It
            was trickier than Punched Cards but not particularly complicated:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            You are part of the executive committee of the Database Design Day
            festivities. You are in charge of promotions and want to print three
            D's to create a logo of the contest. You can choose any color you
            want to print them, but all three have to be printed in the same
            color.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            We had talked about how to solve it during the meeting on Monday and
            had devised a greedy solution: On each loop take one unit of ink out
            of each color until we either run out of ink or we get to the
            desired units of ink.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Karen had written the solution to Punched Cards, I decided
            to start working early on 3D Printing. Our assigned language for
            this problem was typescript, something neither of us was familiar
            with. I managed to build the logic for the printers through the day,
            it was about the same principle as the discussed solution but taking
            all the ink possible up front and then reducing it until getting to
            exactly 10^6.
          </p>
          <p>
            The task to handle the input and output of the problem fell on
            Karen, and that proved to be a challenge on its own since TS alone
            can't handle input, it required a particular library and a fair bit
            of trial and error to figure out how to get it to run on GCJ.
          </p>
          <h4>D1000000</h4>
          <p>
            The third problem turned out to be surprisingly simple, "Longest
            Straight" type of problems are a staple so I had seen some before.
            To solve it you start counting at 1 for the first dice and add +1
            for each dice if the sum is less than the sides of the current dice.
            The resulting number once you have processed all the dice is the
            longest straight that can be built using the dice provided by the
            input.
          </p>
          <p>
            We solved the logic for the problem using Python and then I ported
            it to Dart. The Google Code Jam compiler has issues with the latest
            version of Dart, something we confirmed as every team had trouble
            getting it to run their code. For this problem and this solution, it
            was seemingly running slower than the same algorithm coded in other
            languages, and it timed out during the last test set. However, we
            were able to confirm that it was giving the right answers using the
            provided test data running locally or on replit. With the two
            hardest problems still to come we had to move to the next one on the
            list.
          </p>
          <h4>Chain Reactions</h4>
          <p>
            Chain Reactions was truly a team effort. Bryan had started to work
            on it early so he gave us a high-level explanation of the logic
            necessary to solve the problem. This was later implemented by Adrian
            and Salma using a special node tree class. To cut down on the code I
            rewrote that solution to use a dictionary as the node tree instead,
            so we didn’t need to translate as many lines to Kotlin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm is a postorder traversal, on each node the algorithm
            checks the values of each child node, if the lowest value is higher
            than the value of the current node, replace the value of the current
            node with the lowest value, any nodes that are left over are
            appended to a list and summed at the end.
          </p>
          <h4>Twisty Little Passages</h4>
          <p>
            Twisty Little Passages was the last and most complex problem. In the
            end we had to settle on a brute force solution: Visit as many rooms
            as possible, make an average of the passages in each room, multiply
            that number by the total number of rooms and divide the resulting
            number by two, as each passage connects two rooms.
          </p>
          <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
          <p>
            After the team problems were finished it was time to go back to
            Double or One Thing. It turned out that the reason why it was
            returning the wrong answer was because I hadn’t accounted for words
            that have duplicated letters before going into the algorithm. It was
            a quick fix, only needing three more lines of code and leaving
            everything else unchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found the week to be very productive, I brushed up my Python
            skills, learned more about Typescript and dipped my toes in Dart and
            Kotlin. I’m looking forward to wrapping up this week and starting
            the next module.

            <h3>Week 02: Onboarding Part 2</h3>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The second week at Encora was shorter due to holidays but still
            packed with tons of new stuff. This time around I had the benefit of
            having gone through most of the compliance courses already so some
            of the topics were already familiar before the meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first class of the week was with Roberto to talk about the
            importance of the monthly “town hall” style meeting and the role
            that transparency plays at Encora. He also talked about the upcoming
            Hacker House event in San Luis Potosi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up was The Art of Feedback with Anabel Montiel. Feedback is
            critical at any IT company, some of the recommended material for
            this week was quick to point out that not having a proper feedback
            loop was one of the most common causes for software projects to
            fail. Because Encora has a very horizontal structure the developers
            are expected to guide their own behavior based on the feedback they
            receive from clients or within their team. This approach is summed
            up by the word Ubuntu and its meaning: “I'm at my best when you're
            at your best”.
          </p>
          <p>Some of the recommendations for giving feedback:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't delay and make it worse</li>
            <li>Be empathetic</li>
            <li>Be clear about expectations</li>
            <li>Be comfortable with difficult emotions</li>
            <li>Don't be nice, be helpful</li>
            <li>1 on 1 and group feedback are different</li>
            <li>Follow up and recognize progress</li>
            <li>Make the person feel safe</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            While some of the recommendations for receiving feedback were to “do
            it early and do it often”, that is to actively seek out feedback
            sessions as that will allow us to correct the course early on if
            we're not moving in the right direction. When receiving feedback,
            it's also important to do it with an open mind and focus on the
            content of the message more so than the way it is delivered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our next talk was with the IT department. We talked about their role
            at Encora but also the stuff we should and shouldn't do,
            recommendations regarding use of antivirus, system updates, how to
            create strong passwords, etc. Related to this was also the Security
            Keynotes compliance course that talked about workplace and digital
            security: Tailgating, phishing, vishing, shoulder surfing. As well
            as security while working remotely: Having a clean desk, lockable
            cabinets, locking your laptop, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most interesting classes of the week was the Getting
            Things Done module. GTD is a productivity
            technique-slash-methodology that consists of five steps:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Capture: Write down what's on your mind.</li>
            <li>
              Process: Decide if a captured item is actionable and whether it's
              something we should focus on right now or later
            </li>
            <li>
              Organize: Put things in the right place, give it a spot in the
              calendar or a to-do list.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review: Frequently modify, add or remove elements from your lists.
            </li>
            <li>Act: As the nike slogan says: “Just do it”</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            In addition to everything else we had some recommended reading and
            vids for the week, the most interesting to me was the Search inside
            Yourself talk by Chade-Meng Tan. It enclosed a few different
            concepts in a complete framework for Emotional Intelligence and
            discussed how it can help us achieve our goals.

            <h3>Week 01: Onboarding Part 1</h3>
          </summary>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Between the onboarding meetings and the compliance courses we've
            learned a ton during our first week at Encora:
          </p>
          <p>
            On the first day we were shown some of the specifics of the
            apprentice program, it'll have a duration of about 3 months, the
            first couple of weeks will be focused on learning about Encora's
            processes and corporate culture, with the rest being more technical.
            It is during this latter stage that the hiring and allocation
            process will start for those who show that their existing skills are
            already a good match for one of Encora's client companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the introductory week we've had meetings introducing some
            aspects of Encora: The Mentors, the Leadership Teams, Office
            Management, Encora People Care, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mentors are voluntary Encora staff who chose to help develop junior
            staff, the approach to mentorship at Encora is particular in that it
            is expected that Mentors put the mentees on the right track to
            arrive at a conclusion themselves rather than feeding them
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leadership Teams are groups within the organization, they can vary
            in their focus, some of the most active on slack are the LGBT team
            and Cineclub Encora, the people in charge of The Hub are also a LT.
          </p>
          <p>
            Office Manager oversee the local offices of Encora, they negotiate
            agreements with local businesses to provide benefits and discounts
            for those that are part of Encora, they organize events to bring the
            community together and are also in charge of making sure Encora
            employees have the right equipment for performing their
            responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encora People Care is an organization within Encora that looks to
            get involved with NGOs, some of the events they've organized are
            blood donation drives, pet food drives, donations for vulnerable
            groups, Christmas dinners, etc. Participation is completely
            voluntary, there have been cases where some cause doesn't get enough
            traction for an event.
          </p>
          <p>
            The compliance courses were packed with information as well, on Day
            1 Orientation Program Encora Overview we learned about some of
            Encora's corporate leaders and their history. Encora's core values
            are represented by the anagram ENCODE: Enterprise Value, Curiosity,
            Ownership, Diversity and Excellence. We also learned about Encora's
            services, covering a wide range of topics represented by the
            keywords Envision, Enable, Engineer and Engage.
