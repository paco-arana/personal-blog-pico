        <h3>Week 07: Lightning Talks Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(May 29 - June 7) 10-Minute Individual Presentation</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After finishing the Todo App we were tasked with the Lightning Talks,
          a series of three individual presentations that we should give over
          the next three weeks. The first of these talks should be on a topic
          related to the Todo App and last a total of 10 minutes plus questions.
          The following talks should shorten that time to 7 and then to 5
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my case I decided to focus the talk on the CRUD operations: Create,
          Read, Update and Delete. Because I think the Todo App also serves as
          the perfect way to illustrate this concepts due to its functionality
          and architecture. The cover is a reference to the Evangelion title
          cards, I wonder if anyone actually caught that:

            margin: auto;
            display: flex;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
          "

        />
        <p>
          Salma invited everyone who wanted to join her to give our
          presentations on wednesday but I was the only one who agreed. The rest
          of the apprentice team decided to give their presentations on friday.
          Going first has both advantages and disadvantages: The advantages are
          that you get to set the bar since the expectations are at the lowest,
          you also get the feedback early and can start focusing on the next
          presentation sooner. As to the disadvantages, you don't get to see
          other people's presentations and learn from their mistakes, and have
          in practical terms less time to create and rehearse the presentation.
        </p>
        <img
          style="
            border-radius: 20px;
            width: 95%;
            margin: auto;
            display: flex;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
          "
          src="./pictures/talk1_slide1.png"
          alt="One of the slides of the presentation"
        />
        <p>
          Salma and me had to deal with some unforeseen problems too, namely we
          hadn't set up zoom to allow us to share our screens, so we had to get
          out and back into the meeting halfway before starting our respective
          presentations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that I'd say everything went pretty smoothly. I already
          received some of the feedback and based on that there's points that
          I'd like to work on. I've been told that I don't modulate my voice
          enough, which causes it to become a "drone" in the more wordy parts of
          the presentation. I've also been corrected on the pronunciation of
          some words, like specifically (the "a" is mute) and CRUD (pronounced
          "crud" instead of "cee ar u dee").
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people also brought up positive points, like the visuals of the
          presentation and the balance between the words on the screen and those
          on my script.
        </p>
        <img
          style="
            border-radius: 20px;
            width: 95%;
            margin: auto;
            display: flex;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
          "
          src="./pictures/talk1_final.png"
          alt="Final slide of the presentation"
        />
        <p>
          In the final slide of the presentation I brought back the same thought
          that I used to finish the blog entry last week. Some times you just
          need to ask for help. I wasn't able to get enough rehearsal time with
          Martin Cocoba, who has said he will be helping us with our LTs, that's
          something more I'd like to improve for the next LT.
