        <h3>Week 09: Hyperskill Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 11 - June 17) Music Advisor Wrap-up</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          No big change of pace this week, we picked up right where we had left
          off, having just finished stage 2 of the
          <strong>Music Advisor</strong>. Stages 3, 4 and 5 were lighter on the
          theory but much heavier on the practice. I spent a couple days stuck
          at stage 3/5, just couldn't wrap my mind around how HTTP requests
          worked on Java and if I'm honest never really felt I understood it
          completely, I sort of pieced it through trial and error. The weird
          thing is that now that I look back on it it's crystal clear what it
          does, but at the time? I felt like I was writing a magic spell rather
          than code:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_authcode.png"
          alt="Authorization code"
        />
        <p>
          The good part is that I'd then have to do more of the same for stage
          4/5, so now it's almost burnt into my memory, it should be much easier
          to figure it out if i ever do forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real challenge for stage 4 was actually the tests. I spent a whole
          afternoon figuring out how to work around one of the tests, as it
          seemed like the logic of the test itself was internally flawed in some
          way. The comments in Hyperskill's page said as much and did give some
          hints. I ended up placing the whole block of code in a big try-catch
          block that fed the test the answer it wanted to get.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_trycatch.png"
          alt="Try catch block in code"
        />
        <p>
          By "feeding" I mean that I had to hardcode the error messages printed
          to the user, as actually reading the response error message as
          specified in the instructions would fail the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stage 5 was relatively easier, only really asked that we added
          pagination to the project. It also suggested that we modified the
          project to fit into the Model-View-Controller architecture patter, I
          gave it an honest to god attempt but basically broke everything in the
          process so I rolled back the changes, at that point I also felt I had
          invested far too much time on the Music Advisor project and it was
          time to wrap it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end it took a bit less time to complete than the couple
          previous stages. The tests were complicated to get through but more
          straightforward in the sense that they actually followed the behavior
          specified in the instructions. When I finally got the pop-up window
          telling me I had completed the project I literally stood up from my
          seat:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_finished.png"
          alt="Message shown when finishing a hyperskill project"
        />
        <p>
          I'm happy to put the <strong>Music Advisor</strong> behind me and
          start fresh, I decided on the <strong>Account Service</strong> project
          to do second. It seems like a good deal of the lessons learned in the
          previous project will carry over and I'm crossing my fingers hoping I
          don't get stuck again, as I only have about a week and a half to get
          through two more projects to meet the June 29th deadline.
