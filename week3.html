        <h3>Week 03: Come Together</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            (Apr 14 - Apr 24) Individual and team coding assignments
          </strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The first couple of weeks in Encora were spent getting to know the
          company and completing the prerequisite courses on matters of
          diversity, communication and security. I can't speak for everyone, but
          I know at least I was excited to finally be back to coding after what
          felt like a long break. The activities for the week seemed simple
          enough: An individual problem and five team problems, but we also had
          to balance building the foundations of our personal blog, making the
          technical logs and unexpectedly, organizing newbie Friday. This was
          quite the change from the leisurely pace of the first couple of weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a schedule carefully planned for the week, I'd solve the
          individual challenge on the first couple of days, work with the team
          on the team challenges through the next five days and use the
          remaining time to build the blog, if I had enough time left over, I
          would build the blog using Svelte as an SPA, otherwise I would use
          pico.CSS to whip up something fast. You're most likely looking at that
          “something fast” right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a great plan, but in the words of Mike Tyson: Everyone has a
          plan until they are punched in the face. In my case the punch was
          called “Double or One Thing”.
        </p>
        <h4>Double or One Thing</h4>
        <p>
          We could pick one out of three options for our individual problem.
          Double or One Thing seemed the obvious choice to me, if only because I
          could understand what the problem was even asking for. The
          descriptions for the Google Code Jam problems might as well be written
          in a different language and deciphering them proved to be a valuable
          skill on its own. To quote the problem intro:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          You are given a string of uppercase English letters. You can highlight
          any number of the letters. Then, a new string is produced by
          processing the letters from left to right: non-highlighted letters are
          appended once to the new string, while highlighted letters are
          appended twice. There are multiple strings that can be obtained as a
          result of this process, depending on the highlighting choices. Among
          all of those strings, output the one that appears first in
          alphabetical order.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          To tackle this problem, we are given two options. The first option was
          a brute force solution that writes every possible combination of
          single and double letters to a list, sorts the list, and picks the
          first element. This was simple enough to implement and after a couple
          of hours remembering how to code and another couple figuring out how
          Google Code Jam checks each answer, we had a working solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this wouldn't cut it for all the test sets. The analysis
          page says as much, this algorithm runs out of time once the words get
          large enough. As if that wasn't bad enough, the optimal solution has
          little to do with the brute force solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took another six hours or so to write the second algorithm, most of
          that time was spent writing the wrong algorithm, I had to practically
          start over a couple of times, but we finally had a solution that
          should be capable of solving the samples as well as both tests. But
          somehow, the improved solution was worse than the original. Like a
          person who hasn't worked out in a while, my brain had completely
          depleted its reserve of abstract thoughts. I decided to let it rest
          and come back to the problem after some days.
        </p>
        <h4>Punched Cards</h4>
        <p>
          On Monday, April 17 we got together as a team to decide how we would
          split the work for the week, we decided on an intentionally
          inefficient strategy: We would split the eight-person team into
          couples, for each problem each team was assigned a language out of the
          four we needed to complete the challenge, we would rotate the language
          for each problem. The goal was that everybody had a chance to get
          familiar with Dart and Kotlin, the languages no one had any prior
          experience with.
        </p>
        <p>
          In retrospective that made things harder for everyone. Every problem
          was essentially “solved” in Python and then rewritten to the other
          languages. And once we realized that Kotlin, for example, had a
          Java-like syntax it seemed obvious that those with prior experience
          with Java would be best suited to port the solutions to the language.
          Had we realized these things earlier on we might have saved ourselves
          some trouble, or we might have ended up doing the same since it was
          the most egalitarian choice. Either way, it was an important lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was partnered up with Karen, and for the first problem she had
          already written a solution during the weekend, because that file was
          already on hand it ended up being used to test the GitHub repo that
          Edgar made to store all our solutions. For many of us this was our
          first time uploading to someone else's repository, so that took a bit
          of trial and error to figure out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Punched Cards ended up giving us no problems, the algorithm was simple
          enough: Write X lines Y times. With just a bit of extra code to
          replace the beginning “cell” of the table with dots.
        </p>
        <h4>3D Printing</h4>
        <p>
          For Tuesday we had to work on the second problem, 3D Printing. It was
          trickier than Punched Cards but not particularly complicated:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          You are part of the executive committee of the Database Design Day
          festivities. You are in charge of promotions and want to print three
          D's to create a logo of the contest. You can choose any color you want
          to print them, but all three have to be printed in the same color.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          We had talked about how to solve it during the meeting on Monday and
          had devised a greedy solution: On each loop take one unit of ink out
          of each color until we either run out of ink or we get to the desired
          units of ink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Karen had written the solution to Punched Cards, I decided to
          start working early on 3D Printing. Our assigned language for this
          problem was typescript, something neither of us was familiar with. I
          managed to build the logic for the printers through the day, it was
          about the same principle as the discussed solution but taking all the
          ink possible up front and then reducing it until getting to exactly
          10^6.
        </p>
        <p>
          The task to handle the input and output of the problem fell on Karen,
          and that proved to be a challenge on its own since TS alone can't
          handle input, it required a particular library and a fair bit of trial
          and error to figure out how to get it to run on GCJ.
        </p>
        <h4>D1000000</h4>
        <p>
          The third problem turned out to be surprisingly simple, "Longest
          Straight" type of problems are a staple so I had seen some before. To
          solve it you start counting at 1 for the first dice and add +1 for
          each dice if the sum is less than the sides of the current dice. The
          resulting number once you have processed all the dice is the longest
          straight that can be built using the dice provided by the input.
        </p>
        <p>
          We solved the logic for the problem using Python and then I ported it
          to Dart. The Google Code Jam compiler has issues with the latest
          version of Dart, something we confirmed as every team had trouble
          getting it to run their code. For this problem and this solution, it
          was seemingly running slower than the same algorithm coded in other
          languages, and it timed out during the last test set. However, we were
          able to confirm that it was giving the right answers using the
          provided test data running locally or on replit. With the two hardest
          problems still to come we had to move to the next one on the list.
        </p>
        <h4>Chain Reactions</h4>
        <p>
          Chain Reactions was truly a team effort. Bryan had started to work on
          it early so he gave us a high-level explanation of the logic necessary
          to solve the problem. This was later implemented by Adrian and Salma
          using a special node tree class. To cut down on the code I rewrote
          that solution to use a dictionary as the node tree instead, so we
          didn't need to translate as many lines to Kotlin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The algorithm is a postorder traversal, on each node the algorithm
          checks the values of each child node, if the lowest value is higher
          than the value of the current node, replace the value of the current
          node with the lowest value, any nodes that are left over are appended
          to a list and summed at the end.
        </p>
        <h4>Twisty Little Passages</h4>
        <p>
          Twisty Little Passages was the last and most complex problem. In the
          end we had to settle on a brute force solution: Visit as many rooms as
          possible, make an average of the passages in each room, multiply that
          number by the total number of rooms and divide the resulting number by
          two, as each passage connects two rooms.
        </p>
        <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          After the team problems were finished it was time to go back to Double
          or One Thing. It turned out that the reason why it was returning the
          wrong answer was because I hadn't accounted for words that have
          duplicated letters before going into the algorithm. It was a quick
          fix, only needing three more lines of code and leaving everything else
          unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the week to be very productive, I brushed up my Python skills,
          learned more about Typescript and dipped my toes in Dart and Kotlin.
          I'm looking forward to wrapping up this week and starting the next
          module.
