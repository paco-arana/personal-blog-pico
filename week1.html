        <h3>Week 01: Onboarding Part 1</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Between the onboarding meetings and the compliance courses we've
          learned a ton during our first week at Encora:
        </p>
        <p>
          On the first day we were shown some of the specifics of the apprentice
          program, it'll have a duration of about 3 months, the first couple of
          weeks will be focused on learning about Encora's processes and
          corporate culture, with the rest being more technical. It is during
          this latter stage that the hiring and allocation process will start
          for those who show that their existing skills are already a good match
          for one of Encora's client companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the introductory week we've had meetings introducing some
          aspects of Encora: The Mentors, the Leadership Teams, Office
          Management, Encora People Care, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mentors are voluntary Encora staff who chose to help develop junior
          staff, the approach to mentorship at Encora is particular in that it
          is expected that Mentors put the mentees on the right track to arrive
          at a conclusion themselves rather than feeding them solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leadership Teams are groups within the organization, they can vary in
          their focus, some of the most active on slack are the LGBT team and
          Cineclub Encora, the people in charge of The Hub are also a LT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Office Manager oversee the local offices of Encora, they negotiate
          agreements with local businesses to provide benefits and discounts for
          those that are part of Encora, they organize events to bring the
          community together and are also in charge of making sure Encora
          employees have the right equipment for performing their
          responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encora People Care is an organization within Encora that looks to get
          involved with NGOs, some of the events they've organized are blood
          donation drives, pet food drives, donations for vulnerable groups,
          Christmas dinners, etc. Participation is completely voluntary, there
          have been cases where some cause doesn't get enough traction for an
          event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The compliance courses were packed with information as well, on Day 1
          Orientation Program Encora Overview we learned about some of Encora's
          corporate leaders and their history. Encora's core values are
          represented by the anagram ENCODE: Enterprise Value, Curiosity,
          Ownership, Diversity and Excellence. We also learned about Encora's
          services, covering a wide range of topics represented by the keywords
          Envision, Enable, Engineer and Engage.
