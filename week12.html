        <h3>Week 12: Open Source Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >(July 3 - July 10) Introduction to Open Source Software</strong
          >

        <hr />
        <p>
          When we were told we had to find an open source project to contribute
          to I had a few candidates in mind, I'm a fan of open source software,
          but until now only as a user, I remember using Audacity for mixing
          music tracks together for a Mother's day presentation in middle
          school, using GIMP and Krita as free Photoshop alternatives with mixed
          success, the LibreOffice suite, Blender for 3d modeling and rendering,
          the list goes on and on.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all the open source software mentioned is pretty mature and is
          unlikely to have any low hanging fruit for someone new to the project.
          I instead looked at another project that I use pretty often: Lemuroid
          is an Android app for playing retro games, all the way from the NES to
          the Nintendo 64, being that I've used it for a while I had noticed
          some issues with the spanish translation.
        </p>
        <img
          style="
            border-radius: 20px;
            width: 95%;
            margin: auto;
            display: flex;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
          "
          src="./pictures/week12_phoneshot.jpg"
        />
        <p>
          However it turned out Lemuroid has a separate repository in Crowdin
          for its translation files, and what translation goes in the next
          release is decided through comunity votes. I did a few translations
          but I'd have to look somewhere else for my first pull request.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week12_tlfix.png" />
        <p>
          I ended up doing my very first contribution to the
          "first-contributions" repo which is pretty much a hands-on tutorial to
          learn how to make pull requests. From there I moved to the recomended
          projects list, landing on the Google Chrome repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found an issue in the developer.chrome.com tracker and set out to
          fix it, then I did the corresponding pull request. I submitted it for
          approval, but I'm not sure if it'll even be considered, I followed the
          guidelines to the letter but the notifications under the PR seem to
          suggest that I need to be whitelisted by the maintainers in some way.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week12_pr.png" />
        <p>
          Without doing more pull requests it's hard to know since I don't have
          a frame of reference. I've already started looking at other issues for
          next week in order to fix that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall I think the main benefit of contributing to open source
          software so far has been looking at the variation in project
          structure. Some of the repositories that I visited were a challenge to
          navigate through. Untangling the logic of each project seems like just
          as big of a challenge as the issues themselves.
