        <h3>Week 10: Hyperskill Part 3</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 19 - June 24) Cinema Room REST Service</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Hyperskill</h4>
        <p>
          Previously I had said that after the Music Advisor I'd go for the
          Account Service project, however I quickly changed my mind after
          seeing the difficulty rating and went for the
          <strong>Cinema Room</strong> project instead. Despite being classified
          as "hard" this project proved a lot easier than the first one due to
          not having any of the roadblocks mentioned in previous entries: The
          instructions were more straightforward, it was up to date and the
          tests were written to reflect the actual requirements for each stage.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_completed.png" />
        <p>
          Instead of a couple weeks it took a total of five days to complete the
          Cinema Room: Three days for the sixty-something lessons, working six
          hours at a time give or take, and two more days for the four project
          stages.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_progress.png" />
        <p>
          Due to being short on time I tried to jump into the Account Service
          project stages right away, but got stuck in stage 2/7 which deals with
          Spring Security. I went back to the lessons and now it seems like I
          might be able to work through the second stage but I don't see myself
          progressing through the other five stages fast enough to finish by the
          27th.
        </p>
        <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
        <p>
          I did my second lightning talk on Recursion and Recursive Functions. I
          thought it would be an interesting topic with many visual examples, it
          also gave me the opportunity to relax a little and code a small
          program for drawing flowers as a break from the Hyperskill stuff.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_turtle.png" />
        <p>
          While I think there was a marked improvement from my previous talk I
          still see many areas that need work for the last talk next week. Not
          only individually but also as teams the organization for the LTs has
          been too loose and that's something we should improve for the closing
          session, I'd like to create an introductory slide with our names and
          topics so that guests have something to see while they wait for the
          LTs to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm yet to decide on the topic for my last LT, however I really liked
          the angle Karen gave to her talk about data driven choices in F1.
          Tying the topic to one area of application made it that much easier to
          follow, so I'd like to do something like that. I was tempted to do an
          LT about <em>coding patterns</em> in general and how they originated
          in Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em>, a book on
          Urbanism and Architecture. However I'd rather focus on something that
          I've picked up during the apprentice program.
        </p>
        <h4>Agile Month</h4>
        <p>
          Something I've neglected to mention in previous entries is that we're
          right in the middle of Agile Month at Encora, and we've been having a
          series of talks on the matter. This week we met with Oscar Hernandez
          for the talk <em>User Story Slicing,</em> despite the name it also
          explained what a user story was from the ground up, something very
          useful since I'd only been introduced to the topic recently. To me it
          sounds similar to "personas" used in other design fields.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_agiletalk.png" />
        <p>
          We had one more talk before the end of the week however it wasn't
          related to Agile. We met with Rafael Gutierrez who had been helping us
          with some Java topics to talk about Collections. It was very well
          timed, since it touched on the same topics I was looking at in the
          Hyperskill platform.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_javatalk2.png" />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          While I feel kinda bad about being unable to finish all three
          Hyperskill projects in the time given, I see many more positives than
          negatives. Before this module Java was like a huge wall that I saw no
          way to climb, while now I see a clear path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll look into what I can do to further practice the skills I've
          picked up so far. Hyperskill has other projects that are supposed to
          be completed in one go, I think those would be a good option if we
          retain access to the platform.

        <h3>Week 09: Hyperskill Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 11 - June 17) Music Advisor Wrap-up</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          No big change of pace this week, we picked up right where we had left
          off, having just finished stage 2 of the
          <strong>Music Advisor</strong>. Stages 3, 4 and 5 were lighter on the
          theory but much heavier on the practice. I spent a couple days stuck
          at stage 3/5, just couldn't wrap my mind around how HTTP requests
          worked on Java and if I'm honest never really felt I understood it
          completely, I sort of pieced it through trial and error. The weird
          thing is that now that I look back on it it's crystal clear what it
          does, but at the time? I felt like I was writing a magic spell rather
          than code:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_authcode.png"
          alt="Authorization code"
        />
        <p>
          The good part is that I'd then have to do more of the same for stage
          4/5, so now it's almost burnt into my memory, it should be much easier
          to figure it out if i ever do forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real challenge for stage 4 was actually the tests. I spent a whole
          afternoon figuring out how to work around one of the tests, as it
          seemed like the logic of the test itself was internally flawed in some
          way. The comments in Hyperskill's page said as much and did give some
          hints. I ended up placing the whole block of code in a big try-catch
          block that fed the test the answer it wanted to get.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_trycatch.png"
          alt="Try catch block in code"
        />
        <p>
          By "feeding" I mean that I had to hardcode the error messages printed
          to the user, as actually reading the response error message as
          specified in the instructions would fail the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stage 5 was relatively easier, only really asked that we added
          pagination to the project. It also suggested that we modified the
          project to fit into the Model-View-Controller architecture patter, I
          gave it an honest to god attempt but basically broke everything in the
          process so I rolled back the changes, at that point I also felt I had
          invested far too much time on the Music Advisor project and it was
          time to wrap it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end it took a bit less time to complete than the couple
          previous stages. The tests were complicated to get through but more
          straightforward in the sense that they actually followed the behavior
          specified in the instructions. When I finally got the pop-up window
          telling me I had completed the project I literally stood up from my
          seat:

        />
        <p>
          I'm happy to put the <strong>Music Advisor</strong> behind me and
          start fresh, I decided on the <strong>Account Service</strong> project
          to do second. It seems like a good deal of the lessons learned in the
          previous project will carry over and I'm crossing my fingers hoping I
          don't get stuck again, as I only have about a week and a half to get
          through two more projects to meet the June 29th deadline.

        <h3>Week 08: Hyperskill Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 5 - June 10) Music Advisor Online Course</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I must admit that I was pretty excited to start the Hyperskill module,
          most of what I knew about software prior to entering the
          apprenticeship program I learned in online platforms like Coursera,
          Udemy and Khan Academy. So at least on paper it seemed like I'd be at
          home in the Hyperskill platform, things didn't go as smoothly as I'd
          have hoped though.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first sign that something was different with Hyperskill was
          perhaps the project times. Usually when starting out with a new
          programming language you're told to do (many) short projects in the
          style of "100 days of code" challenges, but instead we were tasked
          with three projects that according to the platform took a couple dozen
          hours to complete each, something that on paper seems like a pretty
          daunting task. On a related note, the estimates themselves also seem
          far too optimistic, as I put a week of full time work into the first
          project and I'm just over the halfway mark it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be fair though, I can imagine that it's only taking so long for me
          to work through the project because I'm almost a complete beginner in
          all things Java, something that should be clear to anyone who looks
          through the code for my To Do App. In that regard the lessons that are
          interspersed with the projects have been quite useful, and I can
          already imagine how much I could improve on that code with what I
          learned through this week. Just as easily I can also imagine a more
          experienced Java user or someone with a more formal education skipping
          through those lessons and finishing the project in half of what it's
          said to take to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          To me the most interesting lessons so far have been those at the end
          of stage 2/5, until then most lessons were dealing with concepts I
          already knew except now on Java, but stuff like Software Architecture,
          Patterns, Class Diagrams, all those are entirely new to me, only
          having heard about them without actually having an understanding of
          what they were and why they were useful.
