        <h3>Week 12: Open Source Part 1</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >(July 3 - July 10) Introduction to Open Source Software</strong
          >
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          When we were told we had to find an open source project to contribute
          to I had a few candidates in mind, I'm a fan of open source software,
          but until now only as a user, I remember using Audacity for mixing
          music tracks together for a Mother's day presentation in middle
          school, using GIMP and Krita as free Photoshop alternatives with mixed
          success, the LibreOffice suite, Blender for 3d modeling and rendering,
          the list goes on and on.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all the open source software mentioned is pretty mature and is
          unlikely to have any low hanging fruit for someone new to the project.
          I instead looked at another project that I use pretty often: Lemuroid
          is an Android app for playing retro games, all the way from the NES to
          the Nintendo 64, being that I've used it for a while I had noticed
          some issues with the spanish translation.
        </p>
        <img
          style="
            border-radius: 20px;
            width: 95%;
            margin: auto;
            display: flex;
            margin-bottom: 30px;
          "
          src="./pictures/week12_phoneshot.jpg"
        />
        <p>
          However it turned out Lemuroid has a separate repository in Crowdin
          for its translation files, and what translation goes in the next
          release is decided through comunity votes. I did a few translations
          but I'd have to look somewhere else for my first pull request.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week12_tlfix.png" />
        <p>
          I ended up doing my very first contribution to the
          "first-contributions" repo which is pretty much a hands-on tutorial to
          learn how to make pull requests. From there I moved to the recomended
          projects list, landing on the Google Chrome repositories.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found an issue in the developer.chrome.com tracker and set out to
          fix it, then I did the corresponding pull request. I submitted it for
          approval, but I'm not sure if it'll even be considered, I followed the
          guidelines to the letter but the notifications under the PR seem to
          suggest that I need to be whitelisted by the maintainers in some way.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week12_pr.png" />
        <p>
          Without doing more pull requests it's hard to know since I don't have
          a frame of reference. I've already started looking at other issues for
          next week in order to fix that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall I think the main benefit of contributing to open source
          software so far has been looking at the variation in project
          structure. Some of the repositories that I visited were a challenge to
          navigate through. Untangling the logic of each project seems like just
          as big of a challenge as the issues themselves.

        <h3>Week 11: Lightning Talks: Part 3</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 24 - June 30) Design Patterns Ignite Talk</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I decided to do my final Lightning Talk on Design Patterns,
          specifically about the origin of design patterns in architecture and
          how they ended up as an integral part of computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an architecture grad, and I love architecture as much as I love
          technology. Two of my favorite books on Architecture are "A Pattern
          Language" and "The Timeless Way of Building" by Christopher Alexander.
          To me those two relatively obscure books are essentially the holy
          books of Architecture. My fanatism aside they were also very
          influential outside of that field, being the originators of Design
          Patterns, that's why I decided to do the final talk on that topic,
          since this was a perfect chance to talk about something I like.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week11_slide1.png" />
        <p>
          I found the ignite format pretty challenging, 5 minutes of 15 second
          slides comes to a total of 20 slides. Since I'm used to doing one
          slide for each minute of presentation it felt like a lot of slides to
          fill. Once I got into rhythm I understood the advantages of the format
          though, I likened it to some guides for making videos for social
          media, where even 15 seconds without changing the content on the
          screen can feel like a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It lends itself better for humour as well, since if a joke on a slide
          falls flat the public is only looking at it for an instant before
          moving to something else.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week11_slide2.png" />
        <p>
          In the end though I couldn't get all 20 slides, I settled for 15
          slides with a duration of 20 seconds each (not including title and end
          slides) which seemed pretty close to the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first tried to get someone on board to do our talk on tuesday 27
          since on wednesday I would leave on a trip to Aguascalientes. Since it
          was still too early I instead got together with Hugo, Adrian and Bryan
          for the final talk on friday 30, the only other day I could fit into
          my trip's schedule. Everything went mostly smooth during the talks, it
          was a good wrap to the module.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week11_slide3.png" />
        <p>
          After finishing the Lightning Talks we were tasked with the Open
          Source module. I've wanted to contribute with FOSS but it feels just a
          bit intimidating to actually do it. I think it will be a fun
          challenge.

        <h3>Week 10: Hyperskill Part 3</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 19 - June 24) Cinema Room REST Service</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Hyperskill</h4>
        <p>
          Previously I had said that after the Music Advisor I'd go for the
          Account Service project, however I quickly changed my mind after
          seeing the difficulty rating and went for the
          <strong>Cinema Room</strong> project instead. Despite being classified
          as "hard" this project proved a lot easier than the first one due to
          not having any of the roadblocks mentioned in previous entries: The
          instructions were more straightforward, it was up to date and the
          tests were written to reflect the actual requirements for each stage.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_completed.png" />
        <p>
          Instead of a couple weeks it took a total of five days to complete the
          Cinema Room: Three days for the sixty-something lessons, working six
          hours at a time give or take, and two more days for the four project
          stages.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_progress.png" />
        <p>
          Due to being short on time I tried to jump into the Account Service
          project stages right away, but got stuck in stage 2/7 which deals with
          Spring Security. I went back to the lessons and now it seems like I
          might be able to work through the second stage but I don't see myself
          progressing through the other five stages fast enough to finish by the
          27th.
        </p>
        <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
        <p>
          I did my second lightning talk on Recursion and Recursive Functions. I
          thought it would be an interesting topic with many visual examples, it
          also gave me the opportunity to relax a little and code a small
          program for drawing flowers as a break from the Hyperskill stuff.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_turtle.png" />
        <p>
          While I think there was a marked improvement from my previous talk I
          still see many areas that need work for the last talk next week. Not
          only individually but also as teams the organization for the LTs has
          been too loose and that's something we should improve for the closing
          session, I'd like to create an introductory slide with our names and
          topics so that guests have something to see while they wait for the
          LTs to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm yet to decide on the topic for my last LT, however I really liked
          the angle Karen gave to her talk about data driven choices in F1.
          Tying the topic to one area of application made it that much easier to
          follow, so I'd like to do something like that. I was tempted to do an
          LT about <em>coding patterns</em> in general and how they originated
          in Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em>, a book on
          Urbanism and Architecture. However I'd rather focus on something that
          I've picked up during the apprentice program.
        </p>
        <h4>Agile Month</h4>
        <p>
          Something I've neglected to mention in previous entries is that we're
          right in the middle of Agile Month at Encora, and we've been having a
          series of talks on the matter. This week we met with Oscar Hernandez
          for the talk <em>User Story Slicing,</em> despite the name it also
          explained what a user story was from the ground up, something very
          useful since I'd only been introduced to the topic recently. To me it
          sounds similar to "personas" used in other design fields.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_agiletalk.png" />
        <p>
          We had one more talk before the end of the week however it wasn't
          related to Agile. We met with Rafael Gutierrez who had been helping us
          with some Java topics to talk about Collections. It was very well
          timed, since it touched on the same topics I was looking at in the
          Hyperskill platform.
        </p>
        <img src="./pictures/week10_javatalk2.png" />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          While I feel kinda bad about being unable to finish all three
          Hyperskill projects in the time given, I see many more positives than
          negatives. Before this module Java was like a huge wall that I saw no
          way to climb, while now I see a clear path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll look into what I can do to further practice the skills I've
          picked up so far. Hyperskill has other projects that are supposed to
          be completed in one go, I think those would be a good option if we
          retain access to the platform.

        <h3>Week 09: Hyperskill Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(June 11 - June 17) Music Advisor Wrap-up</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          No big change of pace this week, we picked up right where we had left
          off, having just finished stage 2 of the
          <strong>Music Advisor</strong>. Stages 3, 4 and 5 were lighter on the
          theory but much heavier on the practice. I spent a couple days stuck
          at stage 3/5, just couldn't wrap my mind around how HTTP requests
          worked on Java and if I'm honest never really felt I understood it
          completely, I sort of pieced it through trial and error. The weird
          thing is that now that I look back on it it's crystal clear what it
          does, but at the time? I felt like I was writing a magic spell rather
          than code:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_authcode.png"
          alt="Authorization code"
        />
        <p>
          The good part is that I'd then have to do more of the same for stage
          4/5, so now it's almost burnt into my memory, it should be much easier
          to figure it out if i ever do forget it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real challenge for stage 4 was actually the tests. I spent a whole
          afternoon figuring out how to work around one of the tests, as it
          seemed like the logic of the test itself was internally flawed in some
          way. The comments in Hyperskill's page said as much and did give some
          hints. I ended up placing the whole block of code in a big try-catch
          block that fed the test the answer it wanted to get.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_trycatch.png"
          alt="Try catch block in code"
        />
        <p>
          By "feeding" I mean that I had to hardcode the error messages printed
          to the user, as actually reading the response error message as
          specified in the instructions would fail the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stage 5 was relatively easier, only really asked that we added
          pagination to the project. It also suggested that we modified the
          project to fit into the Model-View-Controller architecture patter, I
          gave it an honest to god attempt but basically broke everything in the
          process so I rolled back the changes, at that point I also felt I had
          invested far too much time on the Music Advisor project and it was
          time to wrap it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end it took a bit less time to complete than the couple
          previous stages. The tests were complicated to get through but more
          straightforward in the sense that they actually followed the behavior
          specified in the instructions. When I finally got the pop-up window
          telling me I had completed the project I literally stood up from my
          seat:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/hyperskill_finished.png"
          alt="Message shown when finishing a hyperskill project"
        />
        <p>
          I'm happy to put the <strong>Music Advisor</strong> behind me and
          start fresh, I decided on the <strong>Account Service</strong> project
          to do second. It seems like a good deal of the lessons learned in the
          previous project will carry over and I'm crossing my fingers hoping I
          don't get stuck again, as I only have about a week and a half to get
          through two more projects to meet the June 29th deadline.
