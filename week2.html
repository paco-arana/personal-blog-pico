        <h3>Week 02: Onboarding Part 2</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The second week at Encora was shorter due to holidays but still packed
          with tons of new stuff. This time around I had the benefit of having
          gone through most of the compliance courses already so some of the
          topics were already familiar before the meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first class of the week was with Roberto to talk about the
          importance of the monthly “town hall” style meeting and the role that
          transparency plays at Encora. He also talked about the upcoming Hacker
          House event in San Luis Potosi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next up was The Art of Feedback with Anabel Montiel. Feedback is
          critical at any IT company, some of the recommended material for this
          week was quick to point out that not having a proper feedback loop was
          one of the most common causes for software projects to fail. Because
          Encora has a very horizontal structure the developers are expected to
          guide their own behavior based on the feedback they receive from
          clients or within their team. This approach is summed up by the word
          Ubuntu and its meaning: “I'm at my best when you're at your best”.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the recommendations for giving feedback:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Don't delay and make it worse</li>
          <li>Be empathetic</li>
          <li>Be clear about expectations</li>
          <li>Be comfortable with difficult emotions</li>
          <li>Don't be nice, be helpful</li>
          <li>1 on 1 and group feedback are different</li>
          <li>Follow up and recognize progress</li>
          <li>Make the person feel safe</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          While some of the recommendations for receiving feedback were to “do
          it early and do it often”, that is to actively seek out feedback
          sessions as that will allow us to correct the course early on if we're
          not moving in the right direction. When receiving feedback, it's also
          important to do it with an open mind and focus on the content of the
          message more so than the way it is delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our next talk was with the IT department. We talked about their role
          at Encora but also the stuff we should and shouldn't do,
          recommendations regarding use of antivirus, system updates, how to
          create strong passwords, etc. Related to this was also the Security
          Keynotes compliance course that talked about workplace and digital
          security: Tailgating, phishing, vishing, shoulder surfing. As well as
          security while working remotely: Having a clean desk, lockable
          cabinets, locking your laptop, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most interesting classes of the week was the Getting Things
          Done module. GTD is a productivity technique-slash-methodology that
          consists of five steps:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Capture: Write down what's on your mind.</li>
          <li>
            Process: Decide if a captured item is actionable and whether it's
            something we should focus on right now or later
          </li>
          <li>
            Organize: Put things in the right place, give it a spot in the
            calendar or a to-do list.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review: Frequently modify, add or remove elements from your lists.
          </li>
          <li>Act: As the nike slogan says: “Just do it”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In addition to everything else we had some recommended reading and
          vids for the week, the most interesting to me was the Search inside
          Yourself talk by Chade-Meng Tan. It enclosed a few different concepts
          in a complete framework for Emotional Intelligence and discussed how
          it can help us achieve our goals.
