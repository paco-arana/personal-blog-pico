          With Ledger CLI behind us it seemed like things couldn't get much
          harder, looking back on it one week later that seems like a very
          optimistic view. Being objective the premise is much simpler, To-do
          apps are very common beginner projects, in essence it should be much
          simpler than the accounting tool that is Ledger:

          You are working with a client that needs to implement a to do list to
          help manage their tasks in their daily job. The client asked you to
          implement the following functionality:
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Back End</h4>
        <p>
          The back end is proving to be the hardest to crack despite it only
          needing to handle a few requests. Personally I have no experience with
          Java, the language prescribed for the assignment, much less so with
          its related tools like Spring, Maven or Java Collections. To this we
          also have to add the technical issues caused by ZScaler, the company's
          VPN, for obvious security reasons it is particularly aggressive, which
          made it almost impossible to deploy locally for testing. Most of us
          had to resort to disabling during testing which is not an ideal
          solution.

        />
        <p>
          It took essentially the whole week to get a CRUD server to run, as
          once we had solved the ZScaler issue we still had to deal with the
          fiddly Maven installation process, the breaking changes that Spring
          3.0 introduced that rendered most online guides useless and in my case
          my own lack of familiarity with backend development.

        <h4>Front End</h4>
        <p>
          The front end is where most of the functionality of the program is
          located, the specifications were that it had to be built using React,
          a javascript framework. I was already familiarized with react from
          previous projects, but still decided to use a tutorial for building
          the base of the project. Compared to the back end we advanced a great
          deal in the span of a couple of days, with most of the functionality
          implemented.
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          Due to being unable to get the back end running in a timely manner the
          app is currently running with a Firebase database, the functions that
          communicate with the database have been grouped together to make the
          change later to the local java backend
