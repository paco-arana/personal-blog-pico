        <h3>Week 06: To-do Application Part 2</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>(May 21- May 28) Frontend and Backend Development</strong>
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After one more week of work I got my java API up and running, like
          with the frontend the trick was to start by building the most basic
          implementation of a todo app posible, only including id, text and
          done/undone status. Once I built that and connected to it with Postman
          I could start iterating on it, adding the endpoints and all the
          attributes a todo had to have to be up to the project specifications.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_model.png"
          alt="Model used for the todos"
        />
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_running.png"
          alt="Backend running with spring boot"
        />
        <p>
          The frontend was updated as well to be in line with the specifications
          for the UI. Most of the functionality that was previously located in
          the frontend like sorting and filtering was moved to the backend, the
          only functionality of this type that remained coded in the frontend
          was the pagination control. I consider this to be the only real
          deviation from the project specifications, I have to be honest and say
          I simply didn't manage to move it to the backend without breaking
          basically everything in the frontend.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/frontend_base.png"
          alt="View of the frontend on loading the app, some todos have been added for visualization"
        />
        <p>Let's review the specifications for the UI:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Search/Filtering Controls</li>
          <li>
            New To Do Button. This should open a modal to type the “to do” data.
          </li>
          <li>
            Priority column should show in the header the classic up and down
            arrows to allow the user to sort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due date column should show in the header the classic up and own
            arrows to allow the user to sort.
          </li>
          <li>
            Action column to show actions (links/buttons) to allow the user to
            delete or edit a “to do”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pagination control. Showing the pages, its number and the next and
            previous page is enough.
          </li>
          <li>Area to show the metrics</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I think it's all there, I might add a parenthesis on number 5: The
          full specifications said that we <em>could</em> use a modal similar to
          the one used to add a todo, in the case of editing I decided not to
          grey out the rest of the page, to make it faster if I chose to edit
          multiple todos at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll look at some of this points closer as we walk through the
          backend specifications.
        </p>
        <h4>GET Endpoint</h4>
        <p>
          The GET endpoint is by far the most complicated, as it has to handle
          sorting and search, a total of 4 request parameters. Despite this I
          think it's relatively straightforward and self-explaining, somments
          have been added to point what each section does:
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_GET.png"
          alt="GET endpoint in Java backend"
        />
        <p>
          In our app this endpoint is called to not only on loading or searching
          but basically anytime a todo is updated, marked as complete or added,
          as it's our means of updating the display of todos without resorting
          to refreshing the page.
        </p>
        <h4>POST Endpoint</h4>
        <p>
          The POST endpoint is set to receive a task object, it performs
          validations by making sure the received task has the bare minimum
          attributes required, a text field and a priority. In theory it is also
          impossible to submit an empty Todo from the frontend.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_POST.png"
          alt="POST endpoint in Java backend"
        />
        <p>
          As specified, the POST request is made when we click "Add" on our
          modal element. Priority is set to "Low" by default and the user is not
          given the choice to submit a todo without a priority.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/frontend_modal.png"
          alt="View of the modal element in frontend"
        />
        <h4>PUT Endpoints</h4>
        <p>
          There are actually three separate PUT requests that can be made to the
          API, one for the edit menu where we can change a todo's text, priority
          and due date, one for marking a todo as done, and a final one to mark
          a todo as undone. I personally would have preferred to use a single
          "toggle" endpoint to manage both done and undone states, but such was
          the specification.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_PUT.png"
          alt="All three PUT endpoints in the API"
        />
        Each endpoint receives an ID in order to find the todo that is going to
        be updated. In the case of the updateTodo function we also receive a
        task object containing the new information, the same basic validations
        as in the createTodo function are also performed.
        <img
          src="./pictures/frontend_edit.png"
          alt="Editing the todos from the frontend"
        />
        <h4>DELETE Endpoint</h4>
        <p>
          Something that was missing in the original specification was an
          endpoint in the API to delete todos, the especifications only said
          that we should have the means to do it but not how. If there was
          another way to achieve the same thing it didn't seem obvious to me.
        </p>
        <img
          src="./pictures/backend_DELETE.png"
          alt="The endpoint used to delete todos"
        />
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          It's hard for me to write a conclusion to this entry because there is
          still work left to do, namely implementing the tests. However speaking
          on the experience so far I have to say this project taught me to ask
          for help when stuck, I lost a good four days of progress just trying
          to figure out how to run the Java backend, when I finally decided to
          just ask someone we got the basics of the API done in about three
          hours. For the tests I'll go straight to the point and ask one of the
          other apprentices who has already implemented them in their apps.
